# Robotics Navigation Bootcamp

This repository documents the **Robotics Navigation Bootcamp**, an intensive and hands-on training program designed to build strong practical and theoretical skills in autonomous navigation systems.

## Program Overview
The bootcamp runs for **180 days**, with classes held **6 days per week**, **8 hours per day**. It is a full-time commitment focused on real-world robotics navigation challenges.

## Learning Structure
Each day, participants are assigned multiple **practical tasks and exercises** related to navigation, localization, mapping, and path planning. These tasks are designed to reinforce daily lessons through implementation and experimentation.

## Daily Workflow
Students work on their assigned tasks individually, applying concepts such as sensor fusion, SLAM, motion planning, and control. Mentors are available throughout the day for guidance and review.

## Reporting & Evaluation
At the end of each day, participants must submit a **daily work report** summarizing completed tasks, challenges faced, and lessons learned. Progress is evaluated continuously based on task completion and report quality.

## Goal
By the end of the bootcamp, participants will be capable of designing, implementing, and analyzing robust robotics navigation systems in real-world scenarios.
